<h2>About</h2>

<p>The Appscend Media Player allows you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create playlists of synchronized videos and overlays</li>
<li>Configure a playlist from an external JSON file, an equivalent NSDictionary structure or directly via code attributes</li>
<li>Create custom, native overlays</li>
<li>Automatically configure ad linear inserts (pre, mid and post rolls) as well as nonlinear inserts (banner overlays), VAST 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and VMAP 1.0 compliant</li>
<li>Create custom player skins, brand player with logo, insert overlay bugs, customize player controls</li>
<li>Track video and overlay lifecycle events in real-time, as rendered</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>There are currently two integration paths: via CocoaPods or via standard library download.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Installing via CocoaPods (recommended)</strong></li>
</ol>

<pre><code>- Add the player podspec repository to CocoaPods by running:

        pod repo add Appscend http://cocoapods.appscend.net/appscend.git/

- After getting commercial access to the player repository, edit (or create) your `~/.ssh/config` file, and add the following two lines:

        Host cocoapods.appscend.net
        User YOUR_USER_NAME

- Add the following line to your podfile:

        pod 'APSMediaPlayer'

- Run `pod install` to install the player and all the dependencies. Run `pod update` to keep the library updated.
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><strong>Installing via library download</strong></li>
</ol>

<pre><code>- Add `MediaPlayer.framework` and `AVFoundation.framework` to your project.

    - Select your target in the project settings screen.
    - Select the “Build Phases” tab.
    - Expand the “Link Binary With Libraries” area.
    - Click the “+” button, and add “MediaPlayer.framework” and “AVFoundation.framework” to your project.

- Add the player’s static library to your project.

    - Drag the “libAPSMediaPlayer.a” file to your project.
    - When prompted, make sure to check the project target that should link against the static library.
    - Select your target in the project settings screen.
    - Select the “Build Settings” tab.
    - Search for “Other Linker Flags” and make sure that the “-ObjC” flag is present. If it is not, add it.
    - Search for “iOS Deployment Target” and make sure to set the value to iOS 5 and up (iOS &lt; 5 is not supported).

- Add the player’s header files to your project.

    - Drag all the header files in the “headers” folder into your Xcode project OR

    - Select your target in the project settings screen.
    - Select the “Build Settings” tab.
    - Search for “Header Search Paths” and make sure that all the header files are in a location that Xcode knows about.

- Add the player’s resource files to your project.

    - Drag all the files in the “resources” folder into your Xcode project.
    - When prompted, make sure to check the project target that should include the resources.
</code></pre>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>Import the Player’s header file, as well as the VAST/VMAP or other plugins:</p>

<pre><code>#import "APSMediaPlayer.h" 
#import "APSVASTMediaBuilderPlugin.h"
</code></pre>

<p>Create a new APSMediaBuilder instance and add plugins as required APSMediaUnit : </p>

<pre><code>APSMediaBuilder *builder = [[APSMediaBuilder alloc] init]; 
[builder addPlugin:[[APSVASTMediaBuilderPlugin alloc] init]]; 
</code></pre>

<p>Optionally, APSMediaUnit set the debugMode flag to YES to enable console logging: </p>

<pre><code>builder.debugMode = YES;
</code></pre>

<p>Add the media player to a view: </p>

<pre><code>[APSMediaPlayer sharedInstance].view.frame = CGRectMake(5, 5, 310, 450); 
[self.view addSubview:[APSMediaPlayer sharedInstance].view];
</code></pre>

<p>The next step is to create a playlist of <code>APSMediaUnit</code>s to feed to the player for playback. This is what the <code>builder</code> object does; it acts like a configurable <code>APSMediaUnit</code> and <code>APSMediaOverlay</code> factory. Configuration can be done by specifying a URL to a JSON configuration file or by providing a similar configuration structure in a <code>NSDictionary</code> container.</p>

<p>Since remote configuration is a process involving network requests, the builder exposes an asynchroneous configuration method:</p>

<pre><code>[builder configureFromURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://example.com/player.json"] onComplete:^ {
    // TODO: Request and play media units here
}];
</code></pre>

<p>The builder is configured at this point and is able to generate an array of media units ready for playback. When requesting unit generation however, plugins like <code>APSVASTMediaBuilderPlugin</code> require making additional network requests in order to work. So, again, there is an asynchroneous unit retrieval method:</p>

<pre><code>[builder configureFromURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://example.com/player.json"] onComplete:^ {
    [builder requestMediaUnitsWithCompletionBlock:^(NSArray *units) {
        [[APSMediaPlayer sharedInstance] playMediaUnits:units];
    }];
}];
</code></pre>

<p>In the final execution block we instruct the player to start playback using the final generated array of media units, configured remotely via JSON input.</p>
